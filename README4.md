# Project Plan: Enhanced Multi-Model Discussion Framework

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for extending the AI Battle framework to support file-based discussions and enhanced configuration capabilities. The implementation will be structured in phases to ensure maintainable, testable code while preserving the framework's core strengths in meta-prompting and model orchestration.

## Technical Architecture

### New Components

1. **File Processing System**
   - Image handling with resolution preservation
   - Text file processing and chunking
   - MIME type detection and validation
   - File content integration with conversation context

2. **Configuration Manager**
   ```yaml
   discussion:
     turns: 3  # Number of back-and-forth exchanges
     models:
       model1:
         type: "claude-3-sonnet"  # Model identifier
         role: "human"            # Role in conversation
         system_instructions: |
           You are a neurological radiologist with 15 years of experience...
       model2:
         type: "gemini-pro"
         role: "assistant"
         system_instructions: |
           You are an AI assistant collaborating on medical analysis...
     
     input_file:
       path: "./scan.jpg"        # Path to input file
       type: "image"            # image or text
       
     goal: |
       Analyze the provided brain scan and discuss potential abnormalities,
       focusing on regions of concern and possible diagnostic implications.
   ```

3. **Enhanced Context Manager**
   - File content vectorization
   - Multi-modal context handling
   - Content-aware prompt generation
   - Goal-oriented discussion tracking

### Integration Points

1. **Model Client Enhancements**
   - Vision capabilities for image-enabled models
   - File content streaming for large texts
   - Model-specific content preprocessing
   - Capability detection and routing

2. **Conversation Flow Updates**
   - Turn management based on configuration
   - Role-specific instruction handling
   - Goal progress tracking
   - File context maintenance

## Getting Started

1. **Configuration File**
   Create a YAML file (e.g., `discussion_config.yaml`):
   ```yaml
   discussion:
     turns: 3
     models:
       model1:
         type: "claude-3-sonnet"
         role: "human"
         system_instructions: "Expert role definition..."
       model2:
         type: "gemini-pro"
         role: "assistant"
         system_instructions: "Assistant role definition..."
     input_file:
       path: "./input.jpg"
       type: "image"
     goal: "Discussion objective..."
   ```

2. **Running a Discussion**
   ```python
   from ai_battle import ConversationManager
   
   # Initialize with config
   manager = ConversationManager.from_config("discussion_config.yaml")
   
   # Run discussion
   result = await manager.run_discussion()
   ```

This implementation plan ensures systematic development while maintaining the framework's core strengths in meta-prompting and model orchestration. Each phase builds upon the previous one, allowing for regular testing and validation of new features.
