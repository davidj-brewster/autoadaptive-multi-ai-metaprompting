        retry_count: 3           # Number of retries
        notify_on:
          - timeout              # Notify on timeout
          - retry               # Notify on retry
          - error              # Notify on error
     
     input_file:
       path: "./scan.mp4"        # Path to input file
       type: "video"            # image, video, or text
        max_resolution: "4K"     # Maximum resolution to maintain
       
     goal: |
       Analyze the provided brain scan video sequence and discuss potential abnormalities,
       focusing on regions of concern and possible diagnostic implications.

## Getting Started

1. **Configuration File**
   Create a YAML file (e.g., `discussion_config.yaml`):
   ```yaml
   discussion:
     turns: 3
     models:
       model1:
         type: "claude-3-sonnet"
         role: "human"
         persona: "Expert role definition..."
       model2:
         type: "gemini-pro"
         role: "assistant"
         persona: "Assistant role definition..."
     input_file:
       path: "./input.jpg"
       type: "image"
     goal: "Discussion objective..."
   ```

2. **Running a Discussion**
   ```python
   from ai_battle import ConversationManager
   
   # Initialize with config
   manager = ConversationManager.from_config("discussion_config.yaml")
   
   # Run discussion
   result = await manager.run_discussion()
   ```

This implementation plan ensures systematic development while maintaining the framework's core strengths in meta-prompting and model orchestration. Each phase builds upon the previous one, allowing for regular testing and validation of new features.
