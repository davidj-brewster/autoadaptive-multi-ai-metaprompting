## Technical Notes

### Configuration
```python
from configdataclasses import DiscussionConfig

config = DiscussionConfig(
    turns=3,
    models={
        "model1": ModelConfig(
            type="claude-3-sonnet",
            role="expert",
            capabilities=["vision"]
        )
    }
)
```

### Analytics
```python
from metrics_analyzer import MetricsAnalyzer

analyzer = MetricsAnalyzer()
metrics = analyzer.analyze_conversation(conversation_history)
report = analyzer.generate_report(metrics)
```
