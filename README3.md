IMPLEMENTATION LOG

## Current Status
ðŸŸ¡ IN PROGRESS

### 2025-02-19: Initial Implementation
- [x] Added mode parameter to ConversationManager
  - Added mode="human-ai" default parameter
  - Extended initialization to support mode selection
  - Preserved existing functionality

- [x] Extended BaseClient with mode-aware instruction handling
  - Added _get_mode_aware_instructions method
  - Implemented separate instruction handling for each role
  - Maintained existing instruction generation

- [x] Updated run_conversation_turn to support different modes
  - Modified parameter order to fix default argument issue
  - Added mode-aware instruction selection
  - Preserved existing conversation flow

- [x] Modified main() to support mode selection
  - Added default mode parameter
  - Updated ConversationManager initialization
  - Maintained backward compatibility

Pending Tasks:
- [ ] Add tests for mode-specific behavior
- [ ] Implement context optimization
- [ ] Add command-line argument for mode selection
- [ ] Create example configurations for different modes

Next Steps:
1. Create test suite for new mode functionality
2. Implement context optimization system
3. Add mode selection to command line interface
4. Document usage examples for different modes

Note: All changes have been implemented as additive features, preserving the existing human-AI conversation functionality while adding support for AI-AI aware mode where each AI knows it is simulating a human but believes it is talking to a real human.
