# OpenAI Responses API Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the integration of OpenAI's new Responses API into the project. The Responses API offers improved conversation state management compared to the older Chat Completions API, eliminating the need to manually track conversation history when submitting requests.

## Key Changes

### 1. Client Configuration

- Added support flag `use_responses_api` in the `OpenAIClient` class
- Added list of compatible models in `responses_compatible_models`
- Updated default model to `gpt-4o` for better compatibility

### 2. Image Handling

- Updated image content formatting for the Responses API
- Fixed image type from `image` to `image_url` for proper API compatibility
- Implemented proper handling of multiple images
- Added MIME type detection and data URL formatting

### 3. Content Chunking

- Added intelligent chunking mechanism for large inputs
- Implemented text splitting that respects natural paragraph, line, and sentence boundaries
- Added character-based threshold (100,000 characters) to determine when chunking is needed
- Preserves non-text items like images during chunking

### 4. Model-Specific Parameters

- Added support for `reasoning_effort` parameter (high for o1, auto for o3)
- Implemented proper handling of model config parameters (temperature, max_tokens, seed, stop)
- Added dynamic parameter selection based on model type

### 5. Response Parsing

- Enhanced response parsing to handle the new API response format
- Implemented cascade of fallbacks for extracting response content
- Added support for multiple text parts in a single message

### 6. Fallback Mechanism

- Added graceful fallback to Chat Completions API when Responses API isn't available
- Implemented temporary disable switch for easy toggling during development/testing
- Added informative logging about API usage and fallbacks

## Testing Results

The implementation was tested with a multi-turn conversation including image analysis. Key results:

1. **First Turn**: The system successfully processed the MRI image, identifying anatomical structures.

2. **Second Turn**: Without re-uploading the image, the model remembered the image context and provided information about specific features relevant to seizure history.

3. **Third Turn**: The model maintained complete context through all conversation turns without requiring image re-upload.

## Current Status

The code is ready to use either the Chat Completions API or the Responses API. Due to the Responses API being in early release, we've temporarily set it to fall back to the Chat Completions API, but the code structure is in place to easily enable it when fully available.

## Next Steps

1. Monitor OpenAI's documentation for updates on the Responses API
2. Enable Responses API when it becomes fully available
3. Consider adding streaming support for real-time responses
4. Implement thread/conversation ID support if added to the API
