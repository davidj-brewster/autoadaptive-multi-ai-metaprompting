# Documentation Plan: Adaptive Instruction System

This document outlines the plan for creating comprehensive documentation for the Adaptive Instruction System within the AI Battle framework.

## 1. Introduction & First Principles (Why & What)

*   **Goal:** Explain the fundamental problem this system addresses: guiding Large Language Model (LLM) conversations dynamically and contextually, moving beyond static system prompts.
*   **First Principles:**
    *   Discuss the limitations of static prompts (lack of adaptability, context sensitivity, potential for drift, superficiality).
    *   Explain the core principle: using the ongoing conversational context itself as data to intelligently shape the next instruction for the LLM.
*   **Core Idea:** Introduce the system's approach: Analyze Conversation -> Select Strategy -> Customize Instructions -> Guide LLM Turn. Emphasize that this is a meta-cognitive layer managing the LLM's behavior.
*   **Target Audience & Scope:** Define the intended audience (e.g., developers using the framework, researchers interested in conversational AI) and outline the document's scope (conceptual foundations, implementation details, practical usage, customization).
*   **Diagram:** Include a high-level conceptual diagram (non-Mermaid, e.g., block diagram) showing "Conversation History" feeding into "Context Analysis," which informs "Instruction Generation," which then guides the "LLM."

## 2. Comparison with Standard Prompting Techniques

*   **Standard Prompting:** Describe typical approaches (static system prompts, basic role assignment, few-shot examples).
*   **Limitations of Standard:** Reiterate the weaknesses (context-insensitivity, inability to adapt to evolving conversation dynamics, difficulty enforcing complex behaviors consistently).
*   **Adaptive Instruction Advantage:** Contrast with this system's dynamic, context-aware, turn-by-turn instruction generation. Highlight key benefits:
    *   *Adaptability:* Reacts to coherence, complexity, topic shifts.
    *   *Behavioral Shaping:* Enforces specific interaction styles (human simulation, goal focus) more reliably.
    *   *Contextual Relevance:* Instructions are tailored to the immediate state of the dialogue.
    *   *Efficiency:* Aims to achieve desired outcomes more effectively than relying solely on the LLM's internal interpretation of a static prompt.

## 3. System Architecture & Workflow (How - High Level)

*   **Component Overview:** Introduce the key Python classes involved: `AdaptiveInstructionManager`, `ContextAnalyzer`, `InstructionTemplates`, `ConversationManager`, `ModelClient`.
*   **Architectural Diagram:** Provide a clearer architectural diagram (non-Mermaid component diagram).
*   **Core Workflow Sequence:** Use a Mermaid sequence diagram to illustrate the step-by-step instruction generation process:
    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        participant CM as ConversationManager
        participant AIM as AdaptiveInstructionManager
        participant CA as ContextAnalyzer
        participant IT as InstructionTemplates
        participant MC as ModelClient

        CM->>AIM: generate_instructions(history, domain, mode, role)
        AIM->>CA: analyze(history)
        CA-->>AIM: return context_vector
        AIM->>IT: get_templates()
        IT-->>AIM: return base_templates
        AIM->>AIM: _select_template(context_vector, mode, domain)
        AIM-->>AIM: selected_template
        AIM->>AIM: _customize_template(selected_template, context_vector, domain, mode, role)
        AIM-->>CM: return final_instruction_string
        CM->>MC: generate_response(prompt, final_instruction_string, ...)
    ```

## 4. Deep Dive: Context Analysis (`ContextAnalyzer`)

*   **Purpose (Why - First Principles):** Explain the importance and meaning of each `ContextVector` metric (semantic\_coherence, topic\_evolution, response\_patterns, engagement\_metrics, cognitive\_load, knowledge\_depth, reasoning\_patterns, uncertainty\_markers).
*   **Mechanism (How):** Detail calculation methods (TF-IDF, spaCy, Regex, etc.) and rationale.
*   **Impact on Instructions:** Connect metrics back to adaptation logic.

## 5. Deep Dive: Strategy & Customization (`AdaptiveInstructionManager`, `InstructionTemplates`)

*   **Purpose (Why):** Explain the goal of translating context into actionable guidance.
*   **Base Strategies (Templates):** Explain the philosophy and triggers for each template (`exploratory`, `critical`, `structured`, `synthesis`, `goal_oriented`, `ai-ai-*`).
*   **Instruction Customization Layers (How & Why):**
    *   **Behavioral Guidance (Deep Dive):** Elaborate on the rationale and intended cognitive effect of human-simulation/AI-AI instructions.
    *   **Goal-Oriented Logic:** Explain why this is needed and how it forces output.
    *   **Context-Metric Tuning:** Explain fine-grained adjustments.
*   **Concrete Examples:** Provide 2-3 full instruction string examples for different scenarios.

## 6. Usage Instructions & Tips

*   **Integration:** Code examples for using `ConversationManager` with modes/roles.
*   **Modes & Roles:** Practical implications and when to use each (`human-ai`, `ai-ai`, `no-meta-prompting`, `human`/`user`, `assistant`).
*   **Domain/Goal Specification:** Importance and tips for phrasing (`domain` parameter, `GOAL:` prefix).
*   **Tips for Success:** Interpreting responses, steering conversations.

## 7. Customization Guide

*   **Modifying Templates:** How to edit/add strategies in `shared_resources.py`.
*   **Adjusting Customization Logic:** Where to modify behavioral guidance in `_customize_template` (advanced).
*   **Extending Context Analysis:** Potential for new metrics (advanced).

## 8. Model-Specific Behaviors & Considerations

*   **Observed Differences:** Discuss variations in LLM responses to instructions (Claude vs. Gemini vs. OpenAI vs. local).
*   **Potential Tuning:** Suggest areas for model-specific adjustments.

## 9. Testing

*   **Overview:** Importance of testing.
*   **Existing Tests:** Mention `tests/test_adaptive_instructions.py`, `tests/test_context_analysis.py`.
*   **Running Tests:** Provide instructions (e.g., `pytest tests/test_adaptive_instructions.py`).
*   **(Optional) Coverage:** Discuss coverage or future work.

## 10. Conclusion & Future Directions

*   **Summary:** Recap purpose and strengths.
*   **Future Work:** Mention potential enhancements.
