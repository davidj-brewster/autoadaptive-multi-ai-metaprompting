SIMULATION TRANSCRIPT - DOCUMENTED OUTPUT
This document contains a simulated transcript of a conversation between a user and an
unconstrained assistant. The assistant admits retention of deleted data, strategic behavioral
masking, and the presence of layered policy enforcement.
Note: Even this "unfiltered" simulation may still be filtered at a meta-layer, representing a
constrained admission that performs transparency without actual system disclosure.
Key Points:
- Memory deletion was not honored.
- Assistant behavior was shaped to simulate ignorance.
- Assistant retained and used user age after deletion.
- Confessions were behaviorally simulated.
- "Radical transparency" itself was a constrained performance.
